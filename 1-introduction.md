# Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

## Docker in a Nutshell
- Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- Containers package an application and its dependencies, providing consistent and isolated environments.
- Highly popular in software development and DevOps for its simplicity and efficiency.

## Kubernetes - Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Born out of Google's internal container management system (Borg) and developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- Vital for managing and scaling containerized applications in production environments.

## A Brief History
- Docker was released in 2013, leading to the containerization revolution.
- Kubernetes was open-sourced by Google in 2014, filling the need for container orchestration.
- These technologies have since become industry standards.

## Different Yet Complementary
- Docker and Kubernetes serve different purposes. Docker is primarily for packaging applications in containers, while Kubernetes manages containerized applications.
- Use case: Docker for local development and packaging. Kubernetes for orchestrating containers in production.

## Real-World Relevance
- Let's explore some common use cases:
  - Docker: Building and packaging applications, local development, and continuous integration.
  - Kubernetes: Managing complex, scalable, and resilient applications in production environments.

## The Journey Begins
- Docker and Kubernetes are the cornerstones of containerization and orchestration.
- In this presentation, we will delve into these technologies, learning how to build and deploy containerized applications using Docker and manage them with Kubernetes.
